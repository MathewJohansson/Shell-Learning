cat     = view file contents. 
less          = display one page of the file contents at a time.
[spacebar]    = page down. 
q             = quit. 

When giving less the names of several files:
:n            = move to the next file. 
:p            = go back to the previous file. 
:q            = quit. 


head                                = view first 10 lines/rows of a file (csv files are rows and cols).
head seasonal/a then press tab      = lists files starting with a in seasonal.
head -n 5 seasonal/winter.csv       = view first 5 lines/rows of winter.csv 


ls -R        = lists everything below a directory.
ls -R -F     = -F lists all directories with a / after their name, e.g.,
ls -R -F /home/repl


man                        = before anything invokes manual information on it.
                             You can use :n, :p, and :q on this (above!). 
man -n +7 .../spring.csv   = outputs last 7 lines of the file. 


cut                              = select columns from a file. 
cut -f 2-5,8 -d , values.csv     = select cols 2-5 and 8, -f to state fields, 
                                   -d to specify operator, separated by comma. 
cut -d , -f 1 values.csv         = another way to write it.
cut -d, -f1 values.csv           = another way to write it.

cut doesn't understand strings, so "Sharma, Rupinder" will be seen as two separate values.

cut -d : -f 2-4 on the line first:second:third: will treat the : as separators. 


!head        = after using head previously, this re-runs that previous head command.
history      = lists previous commands. 
!head 3      = if the third command was a head command, it will re-run that specific head command.


grep                                 = selects lines according to what they contain. 
grep bicuspid seasonal/winter.csv    = prints all lines in winter.csv that contain "bicuspid". 
-c                                   = prints a count of matching lines.
-h                                   = don't print names of files when searching multiple files. 
-i                                   = ignore case (treats uppercase and lowercase as the same).
-l                                   = prints names of files that contain matches, not the matches.
-n                                   = print line numbers for matching lines. 
-v                                   = invert the match - only show lines that don't match.
