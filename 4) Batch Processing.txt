set             = complete list of all saved variables. 
e.g., 
set | grep HISTFILESIZE     = how many old commands are stored in command history.


USER = variable 
repl = variables' value 

echo USER       = prints USER
echo $USER      = prints USER value, repl


training=seasonal/summer.csv      = sets file as variable training (no spaces!).
head -n 1 $training               = obtains first line from summer.csv (above). 


For Loops: 
for filetype in gif jpg png; do echo $filetype; done


Repeat a command once for each file: 
for filename in seasonal/*.csv; do echo $filename; done


Record the names of a set of files:
files=seasonal/*.csv 
for f in $files; do echo $f; done           = prints list of files in seasonal/


Running many commands in a single loop: 
for file in seasonal/*.csv; do head -n 2 $file | tail -n 1; done
This prints the second line of each data file. 


Print last entry from July 2017 in every seasonal file: 
for file in seasonal/*.csv; do grep 2017-07 $file | tail -n 1; done


Doing many things within a single loop:
for f in seasonal/*.csv; do echo $f; head -n 2 $f | tail -n 1; done
For each file in seasonal, print file, print top two files, print bottom one file.
