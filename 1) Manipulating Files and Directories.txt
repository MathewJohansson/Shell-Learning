How does the shell compare to a desktop interface? 

An operating system is a specific kind of program. 
It controls the computer's processor, hard drive, and network connection, 
but its most important job is to run other programs.

Before computers had graphical displays, though, 
people typed instructions into a program called a command-line shell.



 What is the relationship between the graphical file explorer that most 
 people use and the command-line shell?

    They are both interfaces for issuing commands to the operating system.



pwd = "print working directory" 
pwd takes you to /home/repl - the directory repl sits within the home directory.
It's the current directory that you're working in. 


ls /home/repl/seasonal = lists the files within the seasonal directory.
